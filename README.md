# NAVIS (Nautical AIS Visualisation System)
An Automatic Identification System Visualisation Framework

## What is NAVIS?
NAVIS is an open-source AIS data visualisation framework. It was created to make the visualisation of spatial-temporal AIS data easier.
This framework presented was created to visualise raw AIS data as well as data generated by algorithms.
This tool visualises the trajectory of AIS data and can be used to easy visualise trajectories of vessels.

## What is AIS data?
AIS data is a combination of terrestrial (T-AIS) messages that are continuously collected by onshore receiving stations and satellite AIS messages (S-AIS) arriving in bursts when satellites transfer buffered data onto a ground station.

## What type of visualisations does NAVIS do?
- Static map of up to three vessels
- Animation of a vessel
- Spatial distribution map

## How to use NAVIS?
NAVIS has a Graphical user interface (GUI) to work with. NAVIS works with any database, but the code that is on GitHub makes use of PostgreSQL. One connects to a database with the following structure: MMSI (String), Longitude (float), Latitude (float), sog (float), rot (float), cog (float), trueheading (int), msgtype (int), msgsource (String), datetime (String). In PostgreSQL, the longitude and latitude should be of the type "geom".

## YouTube Video of NAVIS:
A video of NAVIS in action can be seen [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfBeTMqRXUw&feature=youtu.be).

# Getting NAVIS up and running:
## Compatibility:

If you are struggling to install Basemap, please make use of this YouTube [tutorial](https://youtu.be/mXR47qiTdWQ)

### To save a .mkv video file
- [FFMpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html)
- Extract the FFmpeg to the root directory of the Python script
### Database tools
- [Psycopg](http://initd.org/psycopg/download/)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) & [PostGIS](https://postgis.net/install/)
- [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/download.html)

### GUI software
- [Tkinter](https://tkdocs.com/tutorial/install.html)

Alternatively one can make use of the Python pip commands:
~~~~
pip install numpy
pip install pandas
pip install sqlalchemy
pip install psycopg2
pip install matplotlib
pip install tkinter
pip install geos
~~~~

## Setting up the directory
- Download the files as it is currently on this GitHub [repository](https://github.com/cnburger/navis).
- Make sure that the images are in the "Ïmages" file; there should be seven images.
- There should be an empty folder called "Videos"; this is where the animation video will be saved to.
- Make sure that there is a file called "FFmpeg", were the FFmpeg files was extracted to. This folder should have the following within it: "bin", "doc", "presets, "LICENSE", "README".

# Running the script
- Open in your favourite Python editor and run the script from its location
- Open cmd and run it with Python
